You need to connect to an [Aptos][repo] node to use this library, or run one
yourself locally.

## API Docs

Docs can be found [here][api-doc]

## Usage

For Javascript or Typescript usage, check out the [`./examples`][examples] folder with ready-made `package.json` files
to get you going quickly!

If you are using the types in a `commonjs` module, like in a Node app, you just have to enable `esModuleInterop`
and `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` in your `tsconfig` for types compatibility:

```json
{
  ...
  "compilerOptions": {
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true
    ...
  }
}
```

### Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nodejs yarn
```

### Generating Types

Originally created with this:

```bash
$  npx swagger-typescript-api@latest -p ../../../api/doc/openapi.yaml -o ./src/api --modular --axios --single-http-client
```

#### Changes to make after generation:

- OpenAPI/SpecHTML routes/types deleted as they're unneeded.
- There are a few type errors in the `http-client.ts` as the axios types are incomplete, that were fixed
  via `// @ts-ignore`

### Testing (jest)

```bash
yarn test
```
